/*
 * Catalina - Simplified command line wrapper for the Catalina compilation 
 *            system for the Parallax Propeller. Turns catalina options
 *            into LCC options, and then invokes lcc.
 *
 * version 2.0 - initial release (to coincide with bind 2.0)
 *
 * version 2.1 - remove duplicate version number output on '-v'
 *
 * version 2.1 - fixed crash if an option that requires a value is not 
 *               followed by one (e.g. -D)
 *
 * Version 2.3 - Allow for spaces in file/path names.
 *               Fix bug using incorrect LCCDIR for LARGE memory model.
 *               Allow -o to be used with -c and -S options.
 *               Allow upper or lowercase 'k' or 'm' to -M option.
 *
 * version 2.4 - Add '-g' option (passed to lcc, but enables listing). Also
 *               passed to binder to invoke debug file generator. Also sets
 *               the target.
 *               Add SMALL (and __CATALINA_SMALL) symbol when using SMALL
 *               memory model.
 *
 * version 2.4.1 - make it possible to override the target used when -g or
 *               -g3 is specified. If a different target has already been
 *               specified the -g options will not override it. Also, if a
 *               -t option is subsequently parsed, it takes precedence.
 *
 * Version 2.6 - Add Optimizer option (-O).
 *
 * version 2.8 - intercept EEPROM and SDCARD and set layout (1 for EEPROM,
 *               6 for SDCARD).
 *
 * version 2.9 - Added -q option (to test the use of command line symbols) 
 *               and also defined the the PREPROCESS symbol to disable all 
 *               preprocessing code altogether (this code may be removed 
 *               altogether later).
 *
 *               Added statistics (segment and file sizes) generation, and
 *               the '-k' option to suppress them.
 *
 *               Added -R option, for setting the size to use for the 
 *               READ-WRITE segments - i.e. the CODE and CNST segments 
 *               will be shifted to begin at this address. This allows 
 *               memory layout 3 to be used with a combination of SPI 
 *               SRAM (Read/Write) and SPI FLASH (Read Only). For example, 
 *               the following command will put the read/write segments at 
 *               0x08000 and the read only segments at 0x10000:
 *
 *                  catalina hello_world.c -x3 -R32k
 *
 * Version 3.0   Add '-P' option to set base address of read-write segments.
 *               This is similar to the existing '-R' option which sets the
 *               base address of the read-only segments. Also, fixed some
 *               errors in calculating the segment sizes in the presence of
 *               the -P or -R command line options.
 *
 *               Added support for memory layout 4 (XMM SMALL). Now layout
 *               3 is for XMM LARGE mode and LAYOUT 4 is for XMM SMALL mode.
 *               Both these layouts are intended to be used for programs 
 *               that execute from using SPI FLASH, so both layout 3 and 
 *               layout 4 imply FLASH - so you don't need to specify FLASH 
 *               separately if you use -x3 or -x4.
 *
 *               However, if FLASH is specified on the command line, the 
 *               layout is set to 3 unless it has already been set to a 
 *               non-zero value. Also, the SDCARD and EEPROM options now 
 *               work the same way - i.e. they only set the layout if it 
 *               has not already been set to a non-zero value.
 *
 *               Also, the TINY, SMALL and LARGE memory model options can
 *               now be specified on the command line. These set the layout 
 *               to 0, 2 and 5 respectively unless the layout has already 
 *               been set to something incompatible with these. Also, if 
 *               the layout is 3 then SMALL will set it to 4, and if the 
 *               layout is 4 then LARGE will set it to 3. 
 *
 *               The effect of all these changes is that you can now use
 *               EITHER the layout option (-x) to specify the layout - OR - 
 *               use a combination of a memory model option (i.e. TINY, 
 *               SMALL or LARGE) and a loader option (i.e. EEPROM, SDCARD,
 *               FLASH). The relationship between the two ways of specifying
 *               the layout is as follows:
 *
 *               -x0    <==> -C TINY                 (this is the default)
 *               -x1    <==> -C TINY  -C EEPROM      (or just -C EEPROM)
 *               -x2    <==> -C SMALL
 *               -x3    <==> -C LARGE -C FLASH       (or just -C FLASH)
 *               -x4    <==> -C SMALL -C FLASH
 *               -x5    <==> -C LARGE 
 *               -x6    <==> -C TINY  -C SDCARD      (or just -C SDCARD)
 *              
 *               The -x option is basically now just a "shorthand" method.
 *               Note that mixing the two methods is NOT recommended. It
 *               may result in defining some command-line symbols twice.
 *               Also note that invalid combinations are NOT guaranteed to
 *               be detected in all cases!
 *
 * Version 3.0.4 Quote filenames containing spaces on unix as well as windows.
 *
 * Version 3.2 - Make line size 4096 chars.
 *
 * Version 3.5 - Added -C for defining 'Catalina' symbols (which used to be 
 *               defined using -D). Made -D mean define 'C' symbols. Note that 
 *               catbind now also uses -C but that Homespun still use -D. 
 *
 * Version 3.6 - Fix up path processing to correctly override defaults in all
 *               cases (LARGE was not working), and redefine LIBRARY_PATH to
 *               mean the path to the libraries exlculding the final "\lib" 
 *               or "\large_lib" (this is determined by the memory mode).
 *
 * Version 3.7 - Added Compact Memory Model support (CMM).
 *               Allow optimization level 0 (to disable optiimization).
 *
 * Version 3.8 - Added Compact Memory Model support (CMM) to EEPROM and
 *               SDCARD loaders. Also added:
 *
 *               -x8    <==> -C COMPACT
 *               -x9    <==> -C COMPACT -C EEPROM
 *               -x10   <==> -C COMPACT -C SDCARD
 *
 * Version 3.11 - Add support for using openspin as assembler. This is now
 *                the default. 
 *                Remove bstc support.
 *                Remove compile-time support for file preprocessing - this 
 *                is no longer required since bstc support has been dropped,
 *                and both openspin and homespun support symbols defined on
 *                the command-line.
 *                Define the Catalina symols HOMESPUN__ or OPENSPIN__ (and
 *                the corresponding C symbols __CATALINA_HOMESPUN__ or 
 *                __CATALINA_OPENSPIN__) depending on whether the Homespun
 *                or Openspin assemblers are in use.
 *                Make "FLASH is incompatible with current layout" message
 *                a warning only, and ignore the symbol - this makes the 
 *                compilation of Catalyst utility programs much simpler,
 *                otherwise they would need special compilation options.
 *                Added more control over verbosity - default is now minimal
 *                output messages, -v means verbose, -v -v means very verbose.
 *
 * Version 3.12 - Renamed openspin to spinnaker.
 *
 * Version 3.15 - Add P2 support. LMM and NATIVE mode only. 
 *                Propeller 2 indicated by -p2 flag. 
 *                Add p2asm support.
 *                The NATIVE layout is unique to the Propeller 2:
 *
 *               -x11    <==> -C NATIVE
 *
 * Version 3.16 - Option '-k' now also suppresses banners
 *
 *              - Remove Homespun support. Now openspin is the only assembler
 *                supported on the P1, and p2asm is the only assembler
 *                supported on the P2. The '-a' option has been removed.
 *
 * Version 4.1  - Allow -M, -P and -R accept hexadecimal constants. The number
 *                is treated as hexadecimal if it starts with 0x or $ such
 *                as -P $ABCD or -R0xFFFF
 *                Note that they already accepted modifiers, such as 1k or 2m,
 *                but not with hexadecimal numbers.
 *
 * Version 4.6  - Add the -Z and -z command-line options, which enable or 
 *                disable executing the Catalina parallelizer on each input 
 *                file before invoking lcc. For each input file.c for which
 *                the parallelizer is enabled, a file called something like
 *                file_p.c will be generated, and deleted again after lcc
 *                has completed (unless the -u option is also specified).
 *
 *              - implement the -u command-line option, to prevent the
 *                deletion of parallelizer files. This option is also passed 
 *                on to LCC.
 *
 * Version 4.7  - On the P2, NATIVE is now the default memory layout. To
 *                reinstate the previous default of LMM, you have to either
 *                specify -C TINY or use the option -x0
 *
 * Version 4.8  - Updated to fix a bug introduced when making NATIVE the
 *                default memory layout, which defined the symbols for
 *                NATIVE even if another layout was selected.
 *
 * Version 4.9  - Updated to fix a bug in the order of options which meant
 *                that the layout (e.g. -C COMPACT) was being ignored if it 
 *                was specified before -p2 was specified.
 *
 *                Remove -F and -B command line options.
 *
 *                Since the NATIVE memory layout is only supported on a 
 *                Propeller 2, defining the Catalina symbol NATIVE now 
 *                also implies -p2.
 *
 * Version 4.9.3  Add -f, -F and -E command line option (Propeller 2 only):
 *                
 *                   -f requested frequency for which to calculate values
 *                   -F external xtal (XI) frequency
 *                   -E error limit for frequency calculation
 *                
 *                Note that 'm' and 'k' suffix chars mean multiply value by
 *                1,000,000 and 1,000 respectively - i.e. you can say 
 *                -f260Mhz, -f123456kHz, -F25m or -E100k
 *                
 *                Allow complex Catalina symbol definitions on the command 
 *                line, such as:
 *                
 *                   -C "name=value"
 *                
 *                (Note that complex C symbols were already supported via -D).  
 *                
 *                Specifying a frequency defines three Catalina symbols:
 *                
 *                   _CLOCK_XDIV - XI divider (1..64)
 *                   _CLOCK_MULT - XI multiplier (1..1024)
 *                   _CLOCK_DIVP - VCO divider (1, or even numbers up to 30)
 *                
 *                These can also be defined manually, but are only used if all
 *                three are defined. The following Catalina symbols can be 
 *                defined individually:
 *                                
 *                   _CLOCK_OSC - 0=OFF, 1=OSC, 2=15pF, 3=30pF               
 *                   _CLOCK_SEL - 0=rcfast, 1=rcslow, 2=XI, 3=PLL
 *                   _CLOCK_PLL - 0=PLL off, 1=PLL on
 *                                
 *                Specifying complex symbols and clock symbols on the command 
 *                line is only supported on the P2.
 *
 *                The symbols MHZ_260 and MHZ_220 remain supported, but are
 *                now translated into -f260MHz and -f220MHz.                
 *
 * Version 4.9.4  Allow baud rate setting on the command line (P2 only), 
 *                either using the -B command line option, or by defining 
 *                the symbol _BAUDRATE - for example, the following are 
 *                equivalent:
 *                
 *                   -B 9600
 *                   -C "_BAUDRATE=9600"
 *
 * Version 4.9.5 - Add MHZ_300 as a Catalina symbol for -f300Mhz (this 
 *                 allows 300hz to be specified as an option to the 
 *                 build_all batch files and in CATALINA_DEFINE).
 *                 
 *               - Add OPTIMIZE as a Catalina symbol for -O5 (this
 *                 allows optimization to be specified as an option to
 *                 build_all batch files and in CATALINA_DEFINE). Also,
 *                 the default optimization level (i.e. if -O is used
 *                 without a parameter) is now 5 (instead of 1).                 *
 * Version 5.1    Decoding the CATALINA_DEFINE environment variable was 
 *                taking place AFTER the symbols to specify the clock
 *                frequency were defined, so Catalina symbols MHZ_220, 
 *                MHZ_260 & MHZ_300 only worked when specified on the 
 *                command line, and had no effect if specified using
 *                 CATALINA_DEFINE.
 *
 *                Added MHZ_175 and MHZ_200 as a Catalina symobl, to make it 
 *                easier to build Catalyst using either 175Mhz or 200Mhz on 
 *                the Propeller 2 - 175Mhz is now the recommended frequency 
 *                for Catalyst on the P2, to work around an obscure bug that 
 *                occurs at 180Mhz.
 *                
 * Version 5.6    Add Propeller 2 XMM support.
 *                Add OPTIMISE as a synonym for OPTIMIZE
 *
 * Version 6.0    Support DOS 8.3 file names.
 *
 * Version 6.1    add _PASM() macro for use in inline PASM.
 *
 * Version 6.1.1  add _PSTR() macro for use in inline PASM.
 *
 * Version 7.1   - Add support for Quick Build, which means in cases where
 *                 the target is built separately to the program (i.e. XMM,
 *                 EMM and SMM memory models) then if a target file of the 
 *                 correct name already exists, it is used instead of being
 *                 rebuilt. Quick Build is enabled by adding the command line
 *                 option -q or defining the Catalina symbol QUICKBUILD.
 *               - Add option to use external commands for the binary build
 *                 and statistics commands (see binbuild.c and binstat.c).
 *               - Tidy up interpretation of -v and -d options -
 *                 they are now disjoint, and one does not imply
 *                 the other. To see all messages, use both.
 *
 * Version 7.2   - If the -o option is not specified, and -c or -S is not
 *                 specified, the first filename (minus any extension) is 
 *                 used as the default filename. If -c or -S is specified
 *                 but there is more than one filename then -o is ignored.
 * 
 * Version 7.6   - Add the ability to define the Catalina symbol P2, which 
 *                 means the same specifying option -p2. This allows the 
 *                 Propeller version to be specified using CATALINA_DEFINE 
 *                 (the default remains as -p1, so there is no specific 
 *                 symbol needed for that case).
 *
 * Version 7.7  - Just update the version number.
 *
 * Version 7.8  - Just update the version number.
 *
 * Version 7.9  - Add -H option to specify heap top (+1), which is passed
 *                to catbind. HEAP_TOP is used by _sbrk(), but the actual 
 *                value used will be the LOWER of HEAP_TOP and FREE_MEM.
 *
 * version 8.3   - Defining the Catalina Symbol P2 forced NATIVE mode in
 *                 all cases, whereas it should only have done so if no
 *                 other mode had been specified.
 *
 * version 8.8  - add -Q (and -C QUICKFORCE) to mean enable Qquick Build,
 *                but also rebuild the target file even if it already exists.
 *
 * version 8.8.2 - allow -C to also be used to select either cpp or cake as
 *                 the C precompiler, by specifying the C standard as two 
 *                 numeric digits. If no standard is specfied or -C89 or -C90 
 *                 is specified Catalina will use cpp, otherwise Catalina will 
 *                 use cake. 
 *                    
 *                 Catalina will use cpp as the preprocessor by using the 
 *                 existing lcc command (which is unchanged), whereas -C99 
 *                 etc use a new clcc command which invokes cake in place 
 *                 of cpp. 
 *                 
 *                 A warning will be issued if the debug or parallel options 
 *                 are selected when cake is also selected. 
 *                    
 *                 Note that cake currently always defines __STDC_VERSION__ 
 *                 as 202311L for all standards (94, 95, 99, 11, 17, 18, 23)
 *                 whereas cpp does not define it at all. This may change
 *                 in a future Cake release.
 *                 
 * version 8.8.3 - Add -C CAKE_COLOR, which enables the use of colors by Cake
 *                 in error and warning messages. Does nothing unless Cake is
 *                 enabled (e.g. by also adding -C99 etc).
 *               - Also allow -C CAKE_COLOUR ro enable Cake to use color, 
 *               - Use -fdiagnostics-color=never to disable Cake use of color.
 *
 * version 8.8.4  - use "version.h"
 *
 *                - enable 'globbing'
 *
 * version 8.8.8  - Allow debug options to be compbined with C standards 
 *                  other than 89 or 90, but issue a warning that they may
 *                  not be compatible.
